# Spatial_interpolator
The spatial_interpolator is a interpolation tool that takes surveying elevation points as input, and generating digitial elevalation models, using interpolation methods. 

It is developed by me and Chrysanthi Papadimitriou, as one digital terrain modelling [course project](https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/courses/backup/geo1015/2021/hw/01/) as partial fulfillment for the Geomatics master's program. 

There are four interpolation methods implemented for the users to choose:

- nearest neighbour
- IDW with its variants
- linear interpolation with TIN
